<p>SiMSAM stands for <b>Si</b>mulation, <b>M</b>easurement, and <b>S</b>top <b>A</b>ction <b>M</b>oviemaking. It combines the playful, expressive, easy-to-use features of <a href="http://icreatetoeducate.com/">SAM Animation</a> with the precision and testability of programming environments like <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo">NetLogo</a> and <a href="http://www.stagecast.com/">StageCast Creator</a>. </p>

<p>We will be releasing a public version of SiMSAM in June, and will provide a link here then. If you'd like to be notified when it is available, please join our <a href="http://bit.ly/simsam_signup">mailing list</a>. SiMSAM runs best on <a href="https://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/">Chrome</a>.</p>

<a name="how-do-i-install-simsam" class="anchor" href="#how-do-i-install-simsam"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I install SiMSAM?</h3>

<p>SiMSAM runs entirely in your browser, so you don't need to install anything to use it! </p>

<p>If you want to set up a new instance of SiMSAM that would run on your own computer or a different server, here is some information: SiMSAM runs on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> web framework. We have used it successfully with both <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">sqlite3</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mySQL</a> databases. If you are familiar with these, then it should be relatively easy to get the SiMSAM code available here downloaded and up and running on your own system. However, as is the case with many such applications, you may need to change some of the settings that come with the download. We can't guarantee we will be able to help you get set up, but will try to be helpful within reason.</p>

<a name="why-did-you-build-simsam" class="anchor" href="#why-did-you-build-simsam"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did you build SiMSAM?</h3>

<p>We are researchers interested in building upon and connecting the familiar, everyday ways young people make sense of their world to powerful ideas in mathematics, science, and computation. We built SiMSAM to see if by more closely connecting drawing and animation to computer programming and measurement, students would feel more ownership over the programs they create. </p>

<p>We have been using SiMSAM in workshops and classrooms with middle school students to explore everyday scientific processes like diffusion, evaporation, and sound propagation. We do research on how students think and learn with tools like SiMSAM, and how we can better support them.</p>
